        Over the last 10 years or so I’ve done a ton of technical editing work. I’ve helped with CSS
        articles and
        CSS books for various online and print publications. One of the things that comes up often when
        I make
        suggestions is the difference between a CSS rule and a CSS ruleset.

        In most cases, almost all authors use the term “CSS rules” to refer to the blocks of CSS that
        include the
        selector and the CSS declarations. Is this correct?<br>

        <p>The accesskey AttributeRecently I came across a CodePen demo by a developer/engineer named
            Jane that was
            Tweeted out by Šime Vidas. The demo has a neat collection of HTML and CSS tricks rolled into
            one that I
            thought was worth examining in detail.

            The page displays a secret message based on specific text input. Ok, that’s no big deal,
            right? Well
            this is
            done using pure HTML and CSS – no JavaScript. I’ve seen stuff like this before, but I
            thought it would
            be
            cool to break down exactly how this works. There are a few notable things happening in the
            code so I’ll
            break down each of the parts.
